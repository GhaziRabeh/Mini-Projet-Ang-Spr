# E-commerce Application - Full Stack (Frontend & Backend) üõí

This project is a **full-stack e-commerce** application that includes both **backend** and **frontend** components. The backend is built using **Spring Boot** and provides a RESTful API, while the frontend is built using **Angular** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The application implements **CRUD** functionality for managing **categories** and **products**, with a **OneToMany** relationship between categories and products.

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete categories and products.
- **OneToMany Relationship**: A category can have many products, while each product belongs to one category.
- **MySQL Database**: The application uses a MySQL database to store and retrieve categories and products.

## Frontend (Angular) üåê

The frontend of this application is built using **Angular**. It communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to fetch, display, and manage categories and products. The frontend is styled using **Tailwind CSS** to provide a modern, responsive design.

### Key Features üîë

- **CRUD Operations**: Allows users to create, read, update, and delete categories and products from the frontend.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is styled using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring it is responsive across different screen sizes.
- **Angular Services**: Angular services are used to handle HTTP requests to the backend API.

### Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Angular**: The frontend framework for building dynamic web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **HttpClient**: Angular's built-in service to make HTTP requests to the backend API.

### API Consumption üì±

The frontend communicates with the backend by consuming the following APIs:
- **CategoryService**: Makes HTTP requests to manage categories.
- **ProductService**: Makes HTTP requests to manage products.

### Folder Structure üìÇ

- `src/app/`:
  - `components/`: Contains Angular components for displaying categories and products.
